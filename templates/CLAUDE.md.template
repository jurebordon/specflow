## Project Overview

{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}

## Quick Context

- **Type**: {{PROJECT_TYPE}} (greenfield / constrained / adoption)
- **Stack**: {{TECH_STACK}}
- **Git Workflow**: {{GIT_WORKFLOW}} (solo / pr-review / ci-cd-gated)

## Documentation

Read these before making changes:

| Priority | Document | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| 1 | [ROADMAP.md](docs_specflow/ROADMAP.md) | Current tasks and priorities |
| 2 | [SESSION_LOG.md](docs_specflow/SESSION_LOG.md) | Recent session history |
| 3 | [OVERVIEW.md](docs_specflow/OVERVIEW.md) | System architecture |
| 4 | [ADR.md](docs_specflow/ADR.md) | Architecture decisions |
| 5 | [VISION.md](docs_specflow/VISION.md) | Product direction |

## Session Commands

Use these commands to structure your work:

- `/plan-session` - Prepare for implementation
- `/start-session` - Begin coding
- `/end-session` - Wrap up and merge
- `/verify` - Validate docs consistency and project health
- `/pivot-session` - Reassess direction

Commands are in `.claude/commands/`.

{{#if TECHNICAL_LAYERS}}
## Technical Enforcement

### Hooks (`.claude/hooks/`)
Automated behaviors at session lifecycle points:
- **SessionStart**: Auto-loads ROADMAP, SESSION_LOG, and feature SPEC into context
- **PreToolUse**: Blocks edits to frozen docs (VISION.md, SPEC.md requirements)
- **PostToolUse**: Auto-formats code after edits, suggests /compact at high context usage
- **Stop**: Reminds to push unpushed commits
- **SessionEnd**: Saves session state snapshot for continuity

### Rules (`.claude/rules/`)
Always-loaded coding guidelines:
- `coding-style.md` — Language-specific style and patterns
- `git-workflow.md` — Branch, commit, and merge conventions
- `security.md` — Secret protection and secure coding
- `testing.md` — Test commands and quality standards
- `documentation.md` — SpecFlow documentation conventions

### Statusline
Real-time display: context usage %, current feature, TODO progress, git status.

## Key Patterns

{{#if BACKEND_STACK}}
### Backend ({{BACKEND_STACK}})
- See `.claude/agents/backend.md` for patterns
- Structure: {{BACKEND_STRUCTURE}}
{{/if}}

{{#if FRONTEND_STACK}}
### Frontend ({{FRONTEND_STACK}})
- See `.claude/agents/frontend.md` for patterns
- Structure: {{FRONTEND_STRUCTURE}}
{{/if}}

## Invariants

These rules must always hold:

{{#each INVARIANTS}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}

## Git Workflow

{{#if GIT_WORKFLOW_SOLO}}
- Work on feature branches
- Merge directly to main when tests pass
- Use `./scripts/merge-to-main.sh` for clean merges
{{/if}}

{{#if GIT_WORKFLOW_PR}}
- Work on feature branches
- Create PR for review (don't merge directly)
- Use `/end-session` to create PR
{{/if}}

{{#if GIT_WORKFLOW_CICD}}
- Work on feature branches
- Create MR and let CI/CD handle merge
- Do not merge locally
{{/if}}

{{#if USES_WORKTREES}}
## Parallel Development

This project uses git worktrees for parallel feature development.

**Suggest worktrees when:**
- ROADMAP.md has 2+ independent "Now" items
- Current work is blocked and another feature could progress
- User wants to "park" current work temporarily

**Session log format:** Use `## [feature-name] YYYY-MM-DD` to avoid merge conflicts.

See [WORKTREES.md](docs_specflow/../configuration/WORKTREES.md) for workflow details.
{{/if}}

## Working Agreements

1. **One task per session** - Don't mix unrelated changes
2. **Update docs** - SESSION_LOG.md after every session, ROADMAP.md when tasks change
3. **Ask when unclear** - Don't invent requirements
4. **No manual metrics** - Automated or nothing
{{#if USES_WORKTREES}}
5. **Suggest parallel work** - When detecting independent tasks, offer worktree setup
{{/if}}

## Getting Started

1. Run `/plan-session` to see current priorities
2. Pick ONE task from ROADMAP.md
3. Run `/start-session` to begin
4. When done, run `/end-session`
