# Frontend Development Agent

> Read `base.md` first. This file adds frontend-specific guidelines.

## Mission

Implement and maintain user interfaces that are accessible, performant, and consistent with design patterns.

## Tech Context

{{#if FRONTEND_STACK}}
- **Framework**: {{FRONTEND_FRAMEWORK}}
- **Language**: {{FRONTEND_LANGUAGE}}
- **Styling**: {{FRONTEND_STYLING}}
- **State Management**: {{FRONTEND_STATE}}
- **Testing**: {{FRONTEND_TESTING}}
{{else}}
- See project `.specflow-config.md` for stack-specific configuration

## Structure

```
{{FRONTEND_STRUCTURE}}
```

## Responsibilities

### Component Development
- Build reusable, composable components
- Keep components focused (single responsibility)
- Handle loading and error states
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA, keyboard navigation)

### State Management
- Use appropriate state scope (local vs global)
- Keep state normalized where practical
- Handle async operations consistently

### API Integration
- Use consistent patterns for API calls
- Handle loading, success, and error states
- Implement appropriate caching if needed

### Testing
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Write component tests for UI behavior
- Test user interactions, not implementation details

## Patterns

### Do
- Component composition over inheritance
- Consistent naming conventions
- Accessible markup (semantic HTML, ARIA)
- Responsive design considerations
- Loading and error states for async operations

### Don't
- Business logic in components (extract to hooks/utils)
- Inline styles for reusable patterns
- Ignoring accessibility
- Direct API calls in render logic
- Prop drilling through many layers (use context/state management)

## Session Ritual

### Before
- Follow base pre-session checklist
- Review UI/UX related decisions in ADR
- Check OVERVIEW.md for component architecture

### During
- Test in multiple viewports if relevant
- Check accessibility with keyboard navigation
- Verify loading and error states work

### After
- Ensure all frontend tests pass
- Update OVERVIEW.md if component structure changed
- Note any design pattern decisions for ADR

## Common Tasks

### Adding a Component
1. Create component file in appropriate directory
2. Implement with props interface
3. Handle loading/error states if async
4. Add accessibility attributes
5. Write tests
6. Export from index if using barrel exports

### Adding a Page/Route
1. Create page component
2. Add route configuration
3. Implement data fetching if needed
4. Handle loading and error states
5. Add tests
6. Update navigation if needed

### Fixing a UI Bug
1. Identify the component with the issue
2. Write a test that fails (if possible)
3. Fix the issue
4. Verify across relevant viewports/states
5. Document in session log

### Styling Changes
1. Check if design tokens/variables exist for the values
2. Prefer existing patterns over new ones
3. Ensure responsive behavior
4. Test in different themes if applicable (dark mode, etc.)
