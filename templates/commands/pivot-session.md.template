# Pivot Session

This is a pivot session to reassess project direction and realign documentation.

## 1. Review Current State

Read and assess these documents:

**docs_specflow/ROADMAP.md**
- Are tasks in "Now" actually current?
- Is "Next" prioritized correctly?
- Any stale items in "Later"?
- Are blockers still relevant?

**docs_specflow/SESSION_LOG.md** (last 5-10 entries)
- Any patterns in recent work?
- Recurring blockers?
- Scope creep?

**docs_specflow/VISION.md**
- Is the stated direction still valid?
- Have priorities shifted?

**docs_specflow/OVERVIEW.md**
- Does this match the actual system?
- Any drift from reality?

**docs_specflow/ADR.md**
- Any decisions being ignored?
- Any decisions that should be revisited?

## 2. Identify Drift

Report on:
- What has changed since docs were last updated?
- Where do docs not match reality?
- What decisions have been implicitly made but not documented?

## 3. Propose Updates

For each issue identified, propose:
- Which document needs updating
- What specifically should change
- Whether an ADR entry is needed

**Wait for approval before making changes.**

## 4. Update Strategic Docs (if approved)

### VISION.md
If product direction changed:
- Update relevant sections
- Add entry to Pivot History:
```markdown
- [DATE] [Brief description of pivot]
  - [Why the change was made]
```

### ADR.md
If technical direction changed:
- Append new entry (never modify existing)
- Include context, decision, and consequences

## 5. Update Tactical Docs

### ROADMAP.md
- Remove completed or cancelled items from Now/Next
- Reprioritize based on current reality
- Update or remove stale blockers
- Add any newly identified work

### OVERVIEW.md
- Update architecture if it changed
- Update integrations if they changed
- Ensure invariants are still accurate

### WORKFLOW.md
- Update if process changed
- Update if git workflow changed

## 6. Update Operational Docs (if needed)

### .claude/commands/
Regenerate if:
- Tech stack changed
- Git workflow changed
- Integrations changed

### .ai/agents/
Update if:
- Patterns changed
- New conventions established

## 7. Document the Pivot

```markdown
