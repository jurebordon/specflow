# Plan Session

{{#if FEATURE_NAME}}
## Feature Mode: {{FEATURE_NAME}}

Read feature-specific context:
- {{DOCS_PATH}}/features/{{FEATURE_NAME}}/SPEC.md - feature requirements (north star)
- {{DOCS_PATH}}/features/{{FEATURE_NAME}}/ROADMAP.md - current tasks
- {{DOCS_PATH}}/features/{{FEATURE_NAME}}/SESSION_LOG.md (last 2-3 entries) - recent work

Also read project context:
- CLAUDE.md - project overview
- {{DOCS_PATH}}/OVERVIEW.md - system understanding (if needed)

Create a session plan for this feature:

1. **Feature**: {{FEATURE_NAME}}
2. **Session Goal**: ONE task from feature ROADMAP (pick from Now, or top of Next)
3. **Implementation Steps**: Concrete actions to complete the task
4. **Files Likely to Change**: Based on task scope
5. **Success Criteria**: How we'll know it's done
6. **Questions/Blockers**: Anything unclear before starting
