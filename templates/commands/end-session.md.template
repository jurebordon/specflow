# End Session

> Wrap up implementation: test, document, commit, merge/PR.

---

## Step 1: Final Tests

Verify everything works:
```bash
{{TEST_COMMAND}}
```

Fix any failures before proceeding.

---

## Step 2: Update ROADMAP

Edit `docs_specflow/ROADMAP.md`:

1. **Mark task complete**: Check the box for completed task
2. **Move to Done**: If "Now" section is cluttered, move completed items to "Done" with date
3. **Add blockers**: If you discovered new issues, add them

Example:
```markdown
## Now
- [x] Add login endpoint [feature: user-auth]  ← Check this
- [ ] Add password reset [feature: user-auth]

## Done
- [x] Add login endpoint [feature: user-auth] - 2026-01-20
```

---

## Step 3: Log Session

Prepend entry to `docs_specflow/SESSION_LOG.md`:

```markdown
## [{{FEATURE_NAME}}] {{CURRENT_DATE}}

**Task**: [Task description from ROADMAP]
**Branch**: {{CURRENT_BRANCH}}

### Summary
- [What was accomplished]

### Files Changed
- [List key files modified]

### Decisions
- [Design decisions made, or "None"]

### Blockers
- [Issues encountered, or "None"]

### Next
- [Suggested next task]

---
```

---

## Step 4: Update Architecture Docs (If Needed)

Only if significant changes occurred:

**docs_specflow/SPEC.md** (feature-specific):
- Update "Implementation Decisions" section
- Move resolved items from "Open Questions"

**docs_specflow/ADR.md** (project-wide):
- Add entry if major architectural decision was made

**docs_specflow/OVERVIEW.md**:
- Update if system architecture changed

---

## Step 5: Commit All Changes

```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "{{COMMIT_CONVENTION}}: [description]

{{#if TICKETING}}
{{TICKET_FORMAT}}

{{/if}}
Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

---

## Step 6: Merge or Create PR

{{#if GIT_WORKFLOW_SOLO}}
### Solo Workflow - Merge to Main

```bash
git checkout {{DEFAULT_BRANCH}}
git pull origin {{DEFAULT_BRANCH}}
git merge {{CURRENT_BRANCH}}
git push origin {{DEFAULT_BRANCH}}
git branch -d {{CURRENT_BRANCH}}
```
{{/if}}

{{#if GIT_WORKFLOW_PR_GITHUB}}
### Team Workflow - Create PR

Push branch:
```bash
git push -u origin {{CURRENT_BRANCH}}
```

Create pull request:
```bash
gh pr create --title "{{COMMIT_CONVENTION}}: [description]" --body "## Summary
[What was done]

## Test Plan
- {{TEST_COMMAND}} passes
- [Manual testing steps if any]

{{#if TICKETING}}
Closes {{TICKET_FORMAT}}
{{/if}}
"
```

Wait for review before merging.
{{/if}}

{{#if GIT_WORKFLOW_PR_GITLAB}}
### Team Workflow - Create MR

Push branch:
```bash
git push -u origin {{CURRENT_BRANCH}}
```

Create merge request:
```bash
glab mr create --title "{{COMMIT_CONVENTION}}: [description]" --description "## Summary
[What was done]

## Test Plan
- {{TEST_COMMAND}} passes
- [Manual testing steps]
"
```

Wait for CI and review before merging.
{{/if}}

## Step 7: Session Summary

Provide brief summary to user:

```
Session complete!

**Accomplished**: [1-2 sentences]
**Files changed**: [count] files
**Tests**: Passing ✓
**Next**: [Suggested next task from ROADMAP]
```

## Notes

- Always update ROADMAP and SESSION_LOG
- Keep session logs concise - key decisions only
- Feature tags help track work across worktrees
- Test before committing, always
